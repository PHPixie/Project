PHPixie started as a micro framework and has gradually grown to be one of the 
most popular fullstack PHP frameworks while retaining its high performance. 
This is in part because of the strict architecture that avoids common pitfalls 
such as reliance on static methods, global scope, singletons and other antipatterns, 
thus also ensuring that the code is easy to read, debug, extend and test. 
In fact, all PHPixie components boast full unit test coverage. This PHP framework
never stands in your way and provides you with full control over execution 
flow. It's easy to learn and straightforward to master.

But it's not all just about the code. The PHPixie community is very friendly and 
helpfulâ€”you can expect an answer to your question within minutes of asking 
it in the chat. The framework documentation is full of examples and is regularly 
updated with tutorial videos.
